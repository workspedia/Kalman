##### (1) The Bigger Picture
schematic, Charts, (especially) schematic circuits;
The schematic shows the following three dynamic models.
• The one labeled “System Dynamics” models the real-world dynamics in the intended application of the Kalman filter. This model may contain state variables for representing time-correlated random processes .
• The one labeled “State Dynamics” in the Kalman filter should contain a fairly faithful replication of the true system dynamics, except that it does not know the values of the random inputs 𝑤 in the real-world model. 
• The one labeled “covariance dynamics,” is a dynamic model for the second moment (covariance matrix P) of estimation errors.
