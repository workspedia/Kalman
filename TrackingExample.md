little [1], [2] has been given to this important problem of tracking piloted threats. 

This paper treats this problem by first developing a simple target model that closely represents the ensemble behavior of different maneuvering vehicles and that when used in the appropriate Kalman filter yields a tracking algorithm that provides optimal performance for this class of targets and that is easily implemented.
