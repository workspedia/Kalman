#### 1 Introduction
little has been given to this important problem of tracking piloted threats. 
This paper treats this problem by first developing a simple target model that closely represents the ensemble behavior of different maneuvering vehicles and that when used in the appropriate Kalman filter yields a tracking algorithm that provides optimal performance for this class of targets and that is easily implemented.  
This paper, by secondly presenting tracking accuracy figures parametrically as a function of target maneuver characteristics, observation noise, and data rate, permits, by interpolation, an accurate estimation of optimal tracking performance to be made rapidly. 
#### 2 Dynamic Equations of Target Motion
The results are presented for a single physical dimension to facilitate adaption to the range-bearing, range-bearing-elevation,
and bearing-elevation sensor measurement sets that are often provided by any of radar, sonar, and IR sensors.  

The acceleration a(t), since it accounts for the target deviations from a straight line trajectory, will henceforth be termed the target maneuver variable.
