#### 1 Chapter Focus  
- In this chapter, some of the basic notions and mathematical models of statistical and deterministic mechanics are combined into a stochastic system model, which represents the evolution over time of key statistical parameters in systems with uncertain dynamics.
- These stochastic system models are used to define random processes (RPs) in continuous time and in discrete time (also called random sequences). 
- They represent the state of knowledge about a dynamic systemâ€”including its state of uncertainty. 
- They represent what we know about a dynamic system, including a quantitative model for what we do not know.
